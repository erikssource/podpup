Currently, the latest release is v0.3-prealpha. You'll see that in addition to the source code bundles there is a AppImage file and a .exe file. The AppImage file is for running on Linux and the .exe is for installing on Windows. Click on the appropriate link to download.

#### Windows
The podpup.Setup.x.x.x.exe file is an installer, so it will install podpup when it is run. Once finished, Poppup will be added to your available applications.

#### Linux
Beforing running the AppImage file, you'll need to set the permissions on the file to be executable. Once that's done, you can start Podpup by running the AppImage file. You'll be given an option to integrate Podpup with your desktop if you want to which will add it to the available applications for the current user.
